# Full-Stack-App-with-React-and-a-REST-API
Using React to create a client for my existing school database REST API created

The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating, and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. 

## Steps
* Created a react app with a command: ```npx create-react-app client```
* To run the react app, ```cd client, npm start```
* React App is listening on port 3000(localhost:3000 ) 
* The folder 'api' contains the REST API Express application for the school database. It's listsening on port 5000

## Files
* The markup folder contains a collection of HTML files that will show you how each page in the app should be structured.
* The styles/global.css file contains all the styles you will need for this project, but you are encouraged to experiment with things like colors, background colors, and fonts.
* The mockups folder contains a collection of PNG image files showing you how each page should look with the provided HTML and CSS applied.
